 This study employs Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Linear Discriminant 
Analysis (LDA) with a Decision Tree classifier to classify mobile phone prices based on 
specifications. Through data preprocessing and iterative PSO-based feature selection, the model 
identifies key features influencing prices. Leveraging PSO's optimization capabilities and LDA 
for dimensionality reduction, the approach achieves high classification accuracy.
